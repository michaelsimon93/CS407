Accidentally deleted part of my first quiz so ended up deleting the repository so I could start a new version.
Had a compiling error due to a "Shell invocation error" so wasn't able to compile and run the program. Wasn't able to film a demo.

Auto-layout is a bit off. Story board is set up with the buttons, labels, questions, and segues, but segues still need to be programmed 
to pass the data through for the summary.

Overall, not my best work. Had a rough week. Looking forward to earning back the points throughout the semester in future homeworks,
on the exam, and with our app.
