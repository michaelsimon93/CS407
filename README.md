Accidentally deleted part of my original quiz so deleted the originally project and had to start from scratch late. 
Ran into a compiling error "Shell script invocation error" which I am not sure how to fix. Due to this, wasn't able to film a demo.

Auto layout should be set. I've added the buttons, text, image, questions and segues. Created and assigned classes for each 
view controller. Wasn't able to add the code to pass data through the segues.

Not my best work. Had a rough week. Looking forward to making up the lost points throughout the semester.
